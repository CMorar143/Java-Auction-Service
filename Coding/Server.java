/**
 * The server is where all the clients connect in order
 * to gain access to the auction and itâ€™s items.
 * In order to handle multiple clients in concurrency, the Server
 * class consists of a while loop in which the main purpose is to
 * listen and accept all incoming client requests.
 * Once the client is accepted it will create a ClientHandler thread for each one.
 * This enables the server to be able to handle requests from multiple clients at once.
